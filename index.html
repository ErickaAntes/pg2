			<td>House fires may very well be triggered if your home heating sources are not working properly. Be sure to always clean out your air conditioning filters, keep your heaters away from anything that is flammable, and have these things checked out by a professional once a year.</td>
			<td>Household cleaners and items such as hair spray or shaving cream may be very hazardous if exposed to a strong source of heat. Always store these safely in a cool area away from any heaters.</td>
			<td>We get it, it’s nice having some candles lit up around the house to create a romantic atmosphere, or perhaps even getting the fireplace going to make your home feel even toastier on a cold winter evening. We aren’t going to tell you to avoid candles and fireplaces altogether, however we do encourage you to practice with caution. If you feel yourself dosing off, turn off all your candles beforehand, and if you have pets, keep these open flames out of their reach as much as possible.</td>
